# To Do
- Jupyter Documentation and Analysis Explantion
- Pandas Implementation: Currently, the top 10 scorer's data was web-scraped from The NBA's [stats](http://stats.nba.com/) website.
  This will need to be altered to obtain the top 10 info for years other than the 2019-20 season. Also, since the season hasn't ended as of 
  12/19/19, the top 10 players can change in rank, newcomers can enter, etc. Pandas may be a cleaner way of organizing the data and getting 
  the top 10 scorers for any given day.
